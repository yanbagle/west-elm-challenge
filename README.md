# WestElmChallenge

Hi there! The application is deployed at https://yanzhang000.github.io/west-elm-challenge/

Written in Angular2+

To download and run the app locally: 
1. Download/clone the project
2. Cd into the project folder where the package.json is
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. In Chrome, go to http://localhost:4200/

Every time the application starts, a service call is fired retrieving mocked data for the product's images and info.
The application is in a component based structure (e.g. the header, footer, product images and info, etc is in its own component).
I think this way would enable adding new features and pages much simpler in the future as every new page would be a new component.
